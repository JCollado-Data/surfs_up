# surfs_up

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to anaylize the local weather patterns around Oahu to determine if this would be a suitable location for a surf and smoothie shop. By looking at weather patterns and temperatures we can predict the likelyhood people would surf around this location. 

## Results
As we evaluate the data from June and December we can see warm weather. The average temperature in June is 74.94 F and in December 71.04 F. This means we can speculate that on average we can expect a temperature of ~73 F. We can also see both months have a STD between 3.2 and 3.7 we can estimate the average temperature can be within +/- 3 F of the average. 

## Summary
The main objective of this project was to prove to an investor that the location of a new surf and smoothie shop would have consistant weather ideal for surfing/beach going and thus buisness. We evaluate the weather data for Oahu and determind the weather is ideal.
